# Restrict Media Library Access
Just another WordPress Plugin
https://wordpress.org/plugins/restrict-media-library-access/

# Description

This plugin restricts access for Authors and Contributors so they can only see their own Media Library uploads.

This has two main uses: Make it easier for Authors to locate their own uploads when Media Libraries grow very big and prevent Authors from using or downloading media that belongs to other users.

Admins and Editors will still be able to see everyoneâ€™s uploads.
